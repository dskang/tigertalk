* Core
** DONE Add nicks
   - Eventually we want to use Net IDs instead of user chosen nicks
** DONE List people who are online
   - Right column should have list of people who are online
** DONE Manage same user signing in multiple times
   - When a user signs in multiple times, they don't show up in the
     user list multiple times; instead, they are brought to the
     conversation
** DONE Remove user count and replace with array of unique users
   - Also, don't send the user count on every join/part; let the user
     manage all of that client side after seeding the user list/count

** DONE Add contact info for feedback
** DONE Sort the online list
** TODO Users names aren't bolded in online list
** TODO Users remain signed in after quitting
   - Look at Ryan Dahl's chat server
** TODO Deployment
   - Facebook page
   - Facebook ads
   - Google Analytics
   - Team email
* Bugs
** DONE Get rid of ticket information in URL after authenticating
   - Solution: assign user a cookie containing ticket and redirect to
     home
** TODO Width 100% overflows with padding
** TODO Only scroll to bottom when user is already fully scrolled
** TODO Whitespace in beginning of message is ignored in table (feature?)

* Engagement
** TODO Add backlog
   - Useful for engaging users the moment they enter the chatroom
** DONE Add unread messages to document title
   - Listen for browser events (blur, focus) so we know when the focus
     is on window
   - Every time a message comes in, increment unread_msgs count unless
     focus is on window
** DONE Bold nick when you sent message
   - Check nick property when receiving message
** DONE Highlight messages that you're mentioned in
   - Regexp on message field when receiving message
